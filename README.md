This project was originally ment to be as a database for google sites game website, as per the title, "defnotgooglesitegamess".
"def" = definitly
"not google site games" = self explanitory
"[and the extra] s", was because I already had a respetory "defnotgooglesitegames", and so I just put an extra "s" at the end.

Quick note, you can deploy to almost any static site, except render cuz that dosen't work for some reason, but github pages, replit, bitbucket, vercel, netifly, all of those work for deployments, of course if they're not blocked.

This works because this site is pure HTML, exept for some js files for games and the search bar on the home page.

Enjoy!
